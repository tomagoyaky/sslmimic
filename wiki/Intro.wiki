This is a quick overview for using SSLMimic.

= Introduction =

SSLMimic is a tool for inspecting HTTP and HTTPS conversations.

Here is a quickstart example:

= Details =

  * First, download and expand the tar ball.
(Navigate to release page, download, untar)

  * cd into the expanded directory and run the command with the following flags:
{{{
./sslmimic.py -i -d
}}}

We can see here that the first run the program creates an SSL cert to use (if it did not already exist)

  * Configure your web browser to point at the proxy
(Localhost:1443)

Note that your browser will produce SSL warnings, and you'll need to add exceptions for
the SSL secured sites which you visit.
